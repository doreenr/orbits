- GLContext is no longer exposed in the public API.
- No more GLAnimCanvas/GLAnimJPanel variants. To perform animation,
  attach an Animator to a GLDrawable.
- No GLEnum class. Use GL.[GL_CONSTANT_NAME].
- GLFunc/GLFunc14 are named GL.
- GLUFunc/GLUFunc14 are named GLU.
- Drawable factory does not take initial width and height of drawable.
- GLEventListener.reshape() now takes x and y arguments, though these
  should usually be ignored by the application.
- Simpler GLEventListener API; preDisplay and postDisplay have been
  removed. GLEventListener.cleanup is not yet supported as it is not
  clear what the semantics of this routine should be.
